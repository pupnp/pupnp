	Fix memory leaks.


2013-04-27 Thijs Schreijer <thijs(at)thijsschreijer.nl>

	Renamed SCRIPTSUPPORT to IXML_HAVE_SCRIPTSUPPORT for consistency. Also
	updated autoconfig and automake files, so it also works on non-windows.
	Option is enabled by default, because it adds an element to the node
	structure. Not using an available field is better than accidentally
	using an unavailable field.

2012-07-11 Thijs Schreijer <thijs(at)thijsschreijer.nl>

	Changed param to const UpnpAcceptSubscriptionExt() for consistency

2012-06-07 Thijs Schreijer <thijs(at)thijsschreijer.nl>

	updated ixmlDocument_createAttributeEx() and ixmlDocument_createAttribute()
	to use parameter DOMString instead of char * (same but now consistent)

2012-05-06 Thijs Schreijer <thijs(at)thijsschreijer.nl>

	Added script support (directive SCRIPTSUPPORT) for better support of
	garbage collected script languages. The node element gets a custom tag
	through ixmlNode_setCTag() and ixmlNode_getCTag(). And a callback upon
	releasing the node resources can be set using ixmlSetBeforeFree()
	See updated readme for usage.

	SF Bug Tracker id 3510595 - UpnpDownloadXmlDoc : can't get the file

	Submitted: Marco Virgulti ( mvirg83 ) - 2012-03-23 10:08:08 PDT

	There is a problem, perhaps, during downloading a document by
	UpnpDownloadXmlDoc. During debugging i've found that in an not exported
	api (unfortunately i forgot the code line...) where it is setted a
	local variable "int timeout" to -1 then passed directly to another
	function for sending data through tcp socket. I patched this setting it
	to 0 (there is an IF section that exits if timeout < 0). It is normal
	behavior or it is a bug?

2012-03-08 Fabrice Fontaine <fabrice.fontaine(at)orange-ftgroup.com>

	Check for NULL pointer in TemplateSource.h

	calloc can return NULL so check for NULL pointer in CLASS##_new and
	CLASS##_dup.

	Memory leak fix in handle_query_variable

	variable was never freed.

2011-02-07 Chandra Penke <chandrapenke(at)mcntech.com>

	Add HTTPS support using OpenSSL. HTTPS support is optional and can
	be enabled by passing the --enable-open-ssl argument to the
	configure script.

	The following methods are introduced to the public API:
	UpnpInitOpenSslContext

	When enabled, HTTPS can be used by using "https://" instead of
	"http://" when passing URLs to the HTTP Client API.

2011-02-07 Chandra Penke <chandrapenke(at)mcntech.com>

	Refactor HTTP Client API to be more generic.

	The following features are added:

	- Support for persistent HTTP connections (reusing HTTP
	  connections). Tthis is still a work in progress and relies on
	  applications to interpret the 'Connection' header
	  appropriately.

	- Support for specifying request headers when making
	  requests. Useful for interacting with web services that require
	  custom headers.

	- Support for retrieving response headers (this is a API only
	  change, some more work needs to be done to implement the actual
	  functionality. Specifically copy_msg_headers in httpreadwrite.c
	  needs to be implemented)

	- Common API for all HTTP methods.

	- Support for PUT, and DELETE methods.

	The following methods are introduced to the public HTTP Client API

	UpnpOpenHttpConnection, UpnpCloseHttpConnection, UpnpMakeHttpRequest,
	UpnpWriteHttpRequest, UpnpEndHttpRequest, UpnpGetHttpResponse,
	UpnpReadHttpResponse.

	Removed a lot of duplicate code in httpreadwrite.c

2011-01-17 Chandra Penke <chandrapenke(at)mcntech.com>

	Include upnpconfig.h in FileInfo.h to automatically include large
	file macros

2011-01-17 Chandra Penke <chandrapenke(at)mcntech.com>

	Fix for warnings Apple systems related to macros defined in list.h.

	In list.h, in apple systems, undefine the macros prior to defining them.

2011-01-16 Marcelo Jimenez <mroberto(at)users.sourceforge.net>

	Fix for UpnpFileInfo_get_LastModified() in http_MakeMessage().

	UpnpFileInfo_get_LastModified() returns time_t, and http_MakeMessage()
	takes a "time_t *". Thanks to Chandra Penke for pointing the bug.

2010-11-22 Marcelo Jimenez <mroberto(at)users.sourceforge.net>

	Template object for ssdp_ResultData.

2010-11-10 Fabrice Fontaine <fabrice.fontaine(at)orange-ftgroup.com>

	Support for "polling" select in sock_read_write.

	Currently, in sock_read_write function, if the timeout is 0, pupnp
	realizes a "blocking" select (with an infinite timeout). With this
	patch, if timeout is set to 0, pupnp will realize a "polling" select
	and returns immediately if it can not read or write on the socket. This
	is very useful for GENA notifications when pupnp is trying to send
	events to a disconnected Control Point. "Blocking" select can now be
	done by putting a negative timeout value.

2010-09-18 Chandra Penke <chandrapenke(at)mcntech.com>

	This is a minor build fix. The new Template*.h files added in the latest
	code need to be exported. Patch against the latest sources is attached.

	SF Patch Tracker [ 2987390 ] upnp_debug vs. ixml_debug
	Thanks for the load of updates, I'm still assimilating them ! Could I make
	a suggestion though? The addition of printNodes(IXML_Node) to upnpdebug a
	dds a new dependency on ixml.h for anything using upnpdebug.h. I'm making
	quite a bit of use of upnpdebug in porting things to version 1.8.0, and I'd
	prefer it if printNodes could be added to ixmldebug.h instead. I'm attach
	ing a patch, what do you think ?

	SF Patch Tracker [ 2836704 ] Search for nested serviceList (not
	stopping at the first lis
	Submitted By: zephyrus ( zephyrus00jp )
	
	Internet Gateway Device description contains nested serviceList (rootdevice
	-> servicelist, subdevice
	and subdevice has the lower-level serviceList, etc..)

	Unfrotunately, the sample code sample_util.c used by tv_device sample,
	etc.
	has a code that looks for only the first top-level serviceList.
	This results in the failure to read all the services of an IGD xml
	description.

	Attached patch modifies this behavior and looks for the service by
	visiting all the serviceList in xml document in turn.

	With the modified patch (ad additional modification), I could
	simulate an IGD device and created a modified control program for that.

	Patch against 1.6.6

	TIA.

2010-03-15 Marcelo Jimenez <mroberto(at)users.sourceforge.net>
	* SF Patch Tracker [ 2964685 ] patch for avoiding inet_ntoa (1.8.0)
	Submitted By: Nick Leverton (leveret)
	
	Seems like SF's tracker won't let me add a patch to someone else's issue ?!
	This refers to https://sourceforge.net/support/tracker.php?aid=2724578
	
	The calls to inet_ntoa are in getlocalhostname(), which is called from
	UpnpInit when it is returning the bound IP address. 
	UpnpInit/getlocalhostname hasn't been updated to IPv6, I presume this is
	deliberate so that it doesn't start returning IPv6 addresses and
	overwriting the caller's IPv4-sized allocation.
	
	The attached patch just updates getlocalhostname to use inet_ntop instead
	of inet_ntoa, and also documents the fact that UpnpInit is IPv4 only whilst
	UpnpInnit2 is both IPv4 and IPv6.
	
	A fuller solution might be to change UpnpInit to use some variant on
	UpnpGetIfInfo. UpnpInit could still be left as IPv4 only if desired -
	perhaps UpnpGetIfInfo could take an option for the desired address family.
	getlocalhostname and its own copy of the interface scanning code would then
	be redundant. I don't have IPv6 capability here though so I'm reluctant to
	change the IPv6 code, as I have no way to test it.

2010-03-15 Marcelo Jimenez <mroberto(at)users.sourceforge.net>
	* SF Patch Tracker [ 2724578 ] patch for avoiding memory leaks when
	add devices
	
	each time a device been added, UpnpInit() is called, on exit, UpnpFinish()
	is called, but the memories allocated by ThreadPoolInit() may lost because
	there's no code to call ThreadPoolShutdown() to release the memories. And
	inet_ntoa() is not thread safe, so in my patch, I substitute inet_ntoa()
	with inet_ntop().

	* Ingo Hofmann's patch for "Content-Type in Subscription responses".
	Adds charset="utf-8" attribute to the CONTENT-TYPE header line.

	Hi,

	I have found an inconsistency regarding the text/xml content-type
	returned by libupnp. It looks like only subscription responses send
	"text/xml" where all other messages contain "text/xml; charset="utf-8"".
	Since I'm working on an DLNA device the latter behaviour is mandatory.
	I changed the according lines in gena_device.c (see attached patch).
	I'm not sure if it would be ok for other device to have the charset
	field but it would help me a lot :)

	Best regards,
	Ingo

	* SF Bug Tracker [ 1984541 ]
	ixmlDocumenttoString does not render the namespace tag.
	Submitted By: Beliveau - belivo

	The problem occurs when converting a xml document using
	ixmlDocumenttoString containing a namespace tag created with
	ixmlDocument_createElementNS. The namespace tag doesn't get rendered.

	example: The following code fragment prints:

	<?xml version="1.0"?>
	<root></root>

	instead of:
	<?xml version="1.0"?>
	<root xmlns="urn:schemas-upnp-org:device-1-0"></root>
	
	Code:

	#include <stdlib.h>
	#include <upnp/ixml.h>

	int main()
	{
		IXML_Document* wDoc = ixmlDocument_createDocument();
		IXML_Element* wRoot = ixmlDocument_createElementNS(wDoc,
			"urn:schemas-upnp-org:device-1-0", "root");
		ixmlNode_appendChild((IXML_Node *)wDoc,(IXML_Node *)wRoot);
		DOMString wString = ixmlDocumenttoString(wDoc);
		printf(wString);
		free(wString);
		ixmlDocument_free(wDoc);
		
		return 0;
	}

	The problem was in the printing routine, not in the library data
	structure.

	Access violation due to changed usage of pthreads-win32

	Dear libupnp developers,

	I have experienced a crash (access violation) when using libupnp on
	Windows. The crash is actually located in pthreads-win32 and happens
	when repeatedly de-/initializing libupnp on Win32 in the same process
	and both libupnp and pthreads-win32 are compiled as static libraries.

	So I'm doing this:
	- UpnpInit()
	- UpnpFinish()
	- UpnpInit() <- Crash

	I am already in touch with Ross Johnson on the pthreads-win32 mailing
	list regarding this issue:

	http://sourceware.org/ml/pthreads-win32/2013/msg00020.html

	He told me the problem is that the functions
	pthread_win32_process_attach/detach_np() should no longer be called
	directly, but are invoked automatically now since version 2.9.0 of
	pthreads-win32, which has been released approx. 1.5 years ago. Please
	refer to above link for in-depth information.

	So for proper using of latest pthreads-win32 library, those function
	calls should vanish inside libupnp. Could you consider adapting libupnp
	in that way? I would really like to use both libraries out-of-the-box
	without local modifications, and this issue prevents that.

	Best regards,
	Klaus

	tv_ctrlpt crashes after detecting a later version of tvcontrol service

	From:  gon3456@users.sf.net
	Steps to reproduce:
	1. Extracts and build libupnp-1.6.18
	$ tar -xjf /path/to/archive/libupnp-1.6.18.tar.bz2
	$ cd libupnp-1.6.18
	$ ./configure
	$ make
	2. Applies the attached patch and remake.
	$ patch -p1 < /path/to/patch/libupnp-1.6.18.patch
	$ make
	3. Run tv_device.
	$ cd upnp/sample
	$ ./tv_device
	4. Run tv_ctrlpt; the tv_ctrlpt crashes soon.
	$ ./tv_ctrlpt
	Segmentation fault (core dumped)
	This is an issue report about the sample program of control point.
	The tv_ctrlpt crashes after detecting a tvdevice that contains tvcontrol:2 or higher version of tvcontrol service.
	tv_ctrlpt should detect correctly such devices due to forward compatibility of control points with device.
	For more information about the compatibility, please refer the following document:
	DLNA Architectures and Protocols Part 1 2011 December - 7.3.2.1.3 (GUN:GZJXU)
	The attached patch changes the sample programs as below:
	- device: changes version of tvcontrol service from 1 to 2. This change may occur in the future.
	- cp: nothing changed: cp knows version 1 of tvcontrol service only.
	I know many vendors implements their control points based on the tv_ctrlpt, so I hope to fix this issue ASAP.

	==

	From: Yoichi NAKAYAMA
	SEGV is caused by strcpy with NULL argument.
	Attached patch will avoid SEGV in strcpy, but there may be other inconsistencies.

	> I know many vendors implements their control points based on the tv_ctrlpt,

	I don't think so. I think tv_ctrlpt is just a sample to be used with tv_device.

	Patch to fix behaviou when char is signed

	it seems to me that there is still something wrong:

	1)  the new is_qdtext_char() is incorrect.
	There is a trap if char is implemented as signed char.
	Suppose that c is '\xFF', it will be -1 when converted to an int.
	By definition, c should be qdtext:
	qdtext = <any TEXT except <">>
	TEXT = <any OCTET except CTLs, but including LWS>
	OCTET = <any 8-bit sequence of data>

	2) the character after '\\' could be either part of a quoted-pair
	(together with '\\'), or a normal qdtext, since '\\' itself can
	be treated as a qdtext. This is equivalent to saying that the
	character after '\\' in a quoted string could be ANY octet.

	A patch based on the above two observations is attached.

2013-07-30 Sebastian Brandt <s.brandt(at)aixtrusion.de>

	Dear libupnp-devels,
	when POST'ing to the simple web server in libupnp, the application crashes.
	This is caused by a missing "..." argument in webserver.c:1533.
	Seems it has been there for a long time ... 1.6.9 and 1.6.18 have it.

	webserver.c:1533 calls http_MakeMessage
	/* Send response. */
	http_MakeMessage(&headers, 1, 1,
		 "RTLSXcCc",
		 ret, "text/html", X_USER_AGENT);
	The format parameter RTLSXcCc needs four arguments -
	R - response code - ret,
	T- content type - text/html,
	L - struct SendInstruction * - NOT PRESENT
	X - user agent - X_USER_AGENT

	This results in a crash.

	Changing to
	http_MakeMessage(&headers, 1, 1,
		 "RTLSXcCc",
		 ret, "text/html", &RespInstr, X_USER_AGENT);
	solves the situation.

	Yours,
	Sebastian Brandt

	* snprintf does terminate the buffer, so the commit (use buffer size

	* Truncation might be better than crash in some cases. But it may

	Submitted: Nick Leverton ( leveret ) - 2010-04-19 07:44:10 PDT

	Details: The recent codebase merge has removed a significant API call
	which is used by several pupnp devices such as mediatomb and gmediaserver.
	UpnpSetVirtualDirCallbacks() has been replaced by individual routines to
	set each callback. Essentially this means that 1.6.7 will in fact be a majo
	bump and 1.6.6 devices can no longer link against it. Could we have the call
	reinstated please, perhaps as a wrapper around the individual calls ? As
	it is, all distros will have to patch their 1.6.x apps, rebuild and re-link them.

	The other removed API calls and external variables don't seem to be used
	by any of the apps I have copies of, but UpnpSetVirtualDirCallbacks is
	important for maintaining compatibility within 1.6.x.

	Fix for Race condition can hang miniserver thread.

	Add 'requiredThreads' field to the ThreadPool structure, to avoid
	a race condition when waiting for a new thread to be created. The
	race condition occurs when a thread is destroyed while the master
	thread is waiting for a new thread to be created.

	Thanks to Chuck Thomason for pointing the problem.

	Summary: Race condition can hang miniserver thread - ID: 3158591

	Details:
	Hello,

	I have found a race condition in the thread pool handling of
	libupnp-1.6.6 that periodically results in the miniserver thread
	getting blocked infinitely.

	In my setup, I have the miniserver thread pool configured with 1
	job per thread, 2 threads minimum, and 50 threads maximum.

	Just before the lockup occurs, the miniserver thread pool contains
	2 threads: one worker thread hanging around from a previous HTTP
	request job (let's call that thread "old_worker") and the
	miniserver thread itself.

	A new HTTP request comes in. Accordingly, the miniserver enters
	schedule_request_job() and then ThreadPoolAdd(). In
	ThreadPoolAdd(), the job gets added to the medium-priority queue,
	and AddWorker() is called. In AddWorker(), jobs = 1 and threads =
	1, so CreateWorker gets called.

	When we enter CreateWorker(), tp->totalThreads is 2, so
	currentThreads is 3. The function creates a new thread and then
	blocks on tp->start_and_shutdown. The miniserver thread expects
	the newly created thread to increment tp->totalThreads and then
	signal the condition variable to wake up the miniserver thread and
	let it proceed.

	The newly created thread starts in the WorkerThread() function. It
	increments tp->totalThreads to 3, does a broadcast on the
	start_and_shutdown condition, and starts running its job. However,
	before the miniserver thread wakes up, "old_worker" times out. It
	sees that there are no jobs in any queue and that the total number
	of threads (3) is more than the minimum (2). As a result, it
	reduces tp->totalThreads to 2 and dies.

	Now the miniserver thread finally wakes up. It checks
	tp->totalThreads and sees that its value is 2, so it blocks on
	tp->start_and_shutdown again. It has now "missed" seeing
	tp->totalThreads get incremented to 3 and will never be unblocked
	again.

	When this issue does occur for a server device, the miniserver
	port remains open, but becomes unresponsive since the miniserver
	thread is stuck. SSDP alive messages keep getting sent out, as
	they are handled by a separate thread. Reproducing the issue is
	difficult due to the timing coincidence involved, but in my
	environment I am presently seeing it at least once a day. I
	figured out the sequence described above through addition of my
	own debug logs.

	The relevant code involved in this bug has not changed
	substantially in libupnp-1.6.10, though I am planning to test
	against 1.6.10 as well in the near future.

	Do you have any input for an elegant fix for this issue?

	Thanks,

	Chuck Thomason

	Thanks to Chandra Penke for pointing the problem.

	Summary: Problem with large file support in pupnp build - ID: 3158969
	Submitted: Chandra ( inactiveneurons ) - 2011-01-15 16:17:02 BRST
	Details:
	First off, I apologize in advance for the length of this comment, it's
	the only way I could describe the problem accurately.

	Secondly, a brief thanks (again). The company I'm working for has been
	using pupnp for a massively cross-platform project which involves iphone,
	osx, windows, linux x86, arm, and mips hosts. It's amazing how well it
	works, so kudos to the maintainers!

	We came across a problem when compiling with the following tool-chain:
	http://www.codesourcery.com/sgpp/lite/mips/portal/release824. The
	problem is the following:

	In configure.ac the following lines exist to enable large file support:

	AC_DEFINE([_LARGE_FILE_SOURCE], [], [Large files support])
	AC_DEFINE([_FILE_OFFSET_BITS], [64], [File Offset size])

	Which in turn result in the following #defines in autoconfig.h:

	#define _LARGE_FILE_SOURCE /**/
	#define _FILE_OFFSET_BITS 64

	However, this file is not exported as part of the upnp build. Therefore,
	while the entire library gets built with large file support, it's
	possible that dependent libraries which only rely on the include files
	may not use large file support.

	In the particular case of the above tool-chain, the 'off_t' type is 8
	bytes when large file support is enabled, but only 4 bytes when it's
	not. As a result part our stack built on top of pupnp, which did not
	have large file support (because it did not use the above autoconf
	directives), was relying on 'a off_t' that was 4 bytes.

	This caused, among many things, for the UpnpFileInfo struct to break.
	Since the struct is completely invisible outside of pupnp (because of
	some template macro magic), pupnp thought that 'FileLength' field was
	8 bytes, but the header setter/getter methods being used by dependent
	libraries thought that it was 4, which caused some erratic behavior
	when going through pupnp's webserver and HTTP client API.

	We put in a temporary work around by adding the following preprocessor
	flags: -D_LARGE_FILE_SOURCE, -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 as part of our
	build process. However, it's a hack, and I was wondering if I'm missing
	something and there's a better way to approach this.

	Thanks,
	Chandra

	Fixes transfer encoding in the HTTP client API, which is currently
	broken. The break was due to a regression caused by another
	fix (tracker 3056713), which fixed an out of memory crash when
	downloading large files. The previous fix changed the
	http_ReadHttpGet() implementation so that data already read by the
	user was discarded. However, it only worked for transfers where
	the content length was specified. This fix extends the previous
	implementation to cover chunked transfer encoding.

	Added the convenience function UpnpResolveURL2() to upnptools.c.

	This function avoids some unecessary memory allocation.
	The memory alloc'd by this function must be freed later by the caller.

2010-11-10 Fabrice Fontaine <fabrice.fontaine(at)orange-ftgroup.com>

	Add GENA_NOTIFICATION_xxx_TIMEOUT variable.

	Currently, in notify_send_and_recv function, pupnp waits for
	HTTP_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT seconds when trying to send a GENA notification.
	When there is a lot of notifications with CPs which was disconnected
	without unsusbcribing, all the pupnp threads are blocked on this
	timeout. To correct, this issue, this patch adds a new variable,
	GENA_NOTIFICATION_SENDING_TIMEOUT, which can be used to lower the
	timeout so GENA threads return quickly when writing is impossible. By
	the same mean, pupnp waits the CP's answer to the NOTIFY for
	HTTP_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT seconds, so this patch adds a new variable,
	GENA_NOTIFICATION_ANSWERING_TIMEOUT, to customize this value.

2010-11-10 Fabrice Fontaine <fabrice.fontaine(at)orange-ftgroup.com>

	Add --disable-blocking-tcp-connections flag.

	Currently, pupnp is using a blocking connect to sends GENA
	notifications. As a result, when there is a lot of notifications with
	CPs which were disconnected without unsusbcribing, all the pupnp
	threads are blocked for 20s (timeout). To correct this issue, this
	patch replace the call to connect with a call to private_connect and add
	a compilation flag to disable blocking TCP connections, so if we are not
	able to connect to the CP, the notification is lost.

	In threadutil/inc/ithread.h, it is expected that

	Make multiple SSDP advertisements faster.

	Put the loop to send multiple copies of each SSDP advertisements in
	ssdp_server.c instead of ssdp_device.c so we have only one call to
	imillisleep ( SSDP_PAUSE ) to speed up advertisements.

2010-11-05 Fabrice Fontaine <fabrice.fontaine(at)orange-ftgroup.com>

	Removing unused NUM_COPY variable.

	Previously, NUM_COPY was used in ssdp_device.c to send multiple copies 
	of each advertisements but also multiple replies to each M-SEARCH
	request. As sending multiple replies is not compliant with HTTPU/MU
	spec, NUM_COPY has been set to 1 in an older patch. However, as this
	variable is not needed and has been replaced with SSDP_COPY, it has
	been removed.

2010-11-05 Fabrice Fontaine <fabrice.fontaine(at)orange-ftgroup.com>

	Use SSDP_COPY to send multiple SSDP advertisements.

	Currently, SSDP_COPY is used only to send multiple M-SEARCH requests (in
	ssdp_ctrlpt.c). With this patch, SSDP_COPY is also used to send multiple
	copies of each advertisements packets (in ssdp_device.c).

2010-11-01 Carl Benson <carl.benson(at)windriver.com>

	Fix for Android build.

	I had to do some modifications myself though, because the Android
	build system insists on having a file named "util.h" taking precedence
	in its include path, libupnp gets confused because of the same filename
	in upnp/src/inc/util.h

	SF Bug Tracker [ 3086852 ] 99% CPU loop in miniserver.c on a non ipv6
	system.

	Submitted by: Jin ( jin_eld ) - 2010-10-13 19:29:13 UTC

	I cross compiled libupnp 1.6.7 for ARM9 using the --disable-ipv6
	option, my system is an ipv4 only setup.

	I do not know why this problem only appears when running the app in the
	background (for instance using nohup &), but then it starts using 99%
	CPU.

	I traced the problem down to the select() call in miniserver.c in the
	RunMiniServer() function. Select returns code 1, but errno is set to
	"Socket operation on non-socket", I also see this when running my app
	under strace.

	I set all ...Sock6 variables to INVALID_SOCKET to make sure that they
	do not get added to the FD_SET and the problem is gone.

	Bug fix when there is no service in embedded devices

	When a device with embedded devices (like IGD) when created and one of

	SF Tracker [ 2688125 ] v1.6.6 crashes on subdevices without services
	Submitted by: Arno Willig ( akw ) - 2009-03-15 22:45:23 BRT

	I discovered a bug, which will make libupnp (1.6.6) segfault, when you
	create a upnp description document with multiple devices which have
	subdevices, but no own services.

	The crash occurs in genlib/service_table.c in line 977:
	end->next =
		getServiceList( currentDevice, &next_end, URLBase );

	In this case "end" seems not to be defined, so end->next crashes.

	Can anyone confirm this, please?

2010-09-28 Marc Essayan <marc.essayan(at)orange-ftgroup.com>

	Bug fix on burst of GENA notification

	When a lot of notifications were generated by a device in a short
	period of time then 100% of the CPU was used to reorder those
	notifications by pushing back the thread in the job queue. This
	mechanism has been modified so now thread sleep 1 ms before being
	pushed back into the job queue.

	Removing DEFAULT_SCHED_PARAM parameter and use
	sched_get_priority_min(DEFAULT_POLICY) instead.

	Bug fix on M-SEARCH response

	Devices must respond to M-SEARCH requests for any supported version and the

2010-09-21 Fabrice Fontaine <fabrice.fontaine(at)orange-ftgroup.com>

	Addition of WEB_SERVER_CONTENT_LANGUAGE parameter

	This patch adds the WEB_SERVER_CONTENT_LANGUAGE parameter so the user can specify
	the language used by the device during Description and Presentation steps of UPnP
	through the HTTP CONTENT-LANGUAGE header.
	By default, the WEB_SERVER_CONTENT_LANGUAGE is an empty string so no
	CONTENT-LANGUAGE is added.

2010-09-18 Fabrice Fontaine <fabrice.fontaine(at)orange-ftgroup.com>

	Customize the stack size of the threads used by pupnp through the new
	THREAD_STACK_SIZE variable.

	This patch allows a user to customize the stack size of the threads used by
	pupnp through the new THREAD_STACK_SIZE variable. This is especially useful
	on embedded systems with limited memory where the user can set THREAD_STACK_SIZE
	to ITHREAD_STACK_MIN.

	However, as this modification can have side effects, I set 0 as the default
	value, so threads will continue to use the default stack size of the system
	(which varies greatly as stated in
	https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/pthreads/).

	Patch to take notice of UPNP_USE_RWLOCK flag

	The configure.ac file included with UPnP checks for the presence of the
	pthread_rwlock_t type, and then sets the value of the UPNP_USE_RWLOCK

	Using UpnpReadHttpGet to download large files causes the application to
	crash. This happens when the file being downloaded exceeds the device
	memory - entirely possible when transferring video files.
	The programmatic cause is that the logic implemented in the function
	http_ReadHttpGet (which UpnpReadHttpGet calls) reads the entire file
	into memory. The fix modifies the existing logic to discard data after
	it's been read; there's no reason to keep it around since the caller
	of UpnpReadHttpGet already has a copy of it.

	In the latest sources, http_RequestAndResponse and other methods that
	use connect() are broken. More specifically, connect() in these methods

	argument passed to connect() is different in IPV4 vs IPV6 (as described in:
	http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/connect.html).
	The current code always uses the IPV6 size. The fix modifies each use of

	SF Bug Tracker [ 3022490 ] String declaration fix for patch applied in 3007407
	Hello,

	When my patch for tracker ID 3007407 was accepted, the definition of the
	serviceList string was changed from

	#define SERVICELIST_STR "serviceList"

	to

	static const char *SERVICELIST_STR = "serviceList";

	During internal code review of the final patch, it was pointed out that 
	sizeof(SERVICELIST_STR) == 4 since SERVICELIST_STR is now declared as
	a pointer instead of an array.

	If you wish to use a variable instead of a define, I suggest the
	following instead:

	static const char SERVICELIST_STR[] = "serviceList";

	Thanks,

	SF Bug Tracker [ 3007407 ] Service traversal issue in AdvertiseAndReply()
	Submitted: Chuck Thomason ( cyt4 ) - 2010-05-26 15:07:39 UTC

	When the UPnP server is started, one alive message is broadcast for each
	service in each device. It appears that libupnp's implementation of the
	alive message generation does not correctly navigate the XML description
	document when locating the services. This can result in the wrong UDN
	being used in the alive message sent for a service.

	In my specific case (see attached XML), the root EchoSTB device contains
	no services, but its embedded MediaServer device contains 2 services.
	When the existing libupnp code traverses the EchoSTB device in the XML,
	it searches the global list of serviceLists within the document instead
	of searching for a serviceList that is its direct child node. The
	ContentDirectory and ConnectionManager services are then announced with
	the UDN of EchoSTB1 (the root device) instead of with the UDN of
	MediaServer, which is actually their parent device.

	I discovered this behavior using libupnp-1.6.6. I have generated a patch
	against branch-1.6.x that corrects the XML navigation such that all
	services are traversed from their parent device, which results in the
	correct UDN being sent in the alive message for each service. I built
	from branch-1.6.x without this patch, tested, and confirmed that the
	issue still exists as I observed it in libupnp-1.6.6. I then built
	from branch-1.6.x with this patch, tested, and confirmed that the
	issue was resolved.

	Thanks,

	Submitted: Stulle ( stulleamgym ) - 2009-10-10 19:05

	Hi,

	I am one of the devs of the MorphXT project and I use this lib in some
	other of my projects, too. When I tried to upgrade the lib earlier for one
	of my projects I had to realise that something did not work at first and
	while most of the things were reasonably ease to be fixed. Now, the last
	thing I encountered was not so easy to fix and I am uncertain if my fix is
	any good so I'll just post it here and wait for some comments.

	The problem was that I got an Access Violation when calling "UpnpInit". It
	would call "ithread_rwlock_init(&GlobalHndRWLock, NULL)" which eventually
	led to calling "pthread_cond_init" and I got the error notice at
	"EnterCriticalSection (&ptw32_cond_list_lock);". It appeared that
	"ptw32_cond_list_lock" was NULL. Now, I found two ways to fix this. Firstly
	moving the whole block after at least one of the "ThreadPoolInit" calls
	will fix the issue. Secondly, you could add:
	#ifdef WIN32
	#ifdef PTW32_STATIC_LIB
	// to get the following working we need this... is it a good patch or
	not... I do not know!
	pthread_win32_process_attach_np();
	#endif
	#endif
	right before "ithread_rwlock_init(&GlobalHndRWLock, NULL)".

	Just so you know, I am using libupnp 1.6.6 and libpthreads 2.8.0 and both
	are linked static into the binaries. I am currently using Visual Studio
	2008 for development with Windows being the target OS. Any comment at your
	end?

	Regards, Stulle

	* libupnp and multi-flows scenario patch
	Submited by Carlo Parata from STMicroelectronics.

	Hi Roberto and Nektarios,
	after an analysis of the problem of libupnp with a multi-flows scenario, I
	noticed that the only cause of the freezed system is the ThreadPool
	management. There are not mutex problems. In practise, if all threads in the
	thread pool are busy executing jobs, a new worker thread should be created if
	a job is scheduled (I inspired to tombupnp library). So I solved the problem
	with a little patch in threadutil library that you can find attached in this
	e-mail. I hope to have helped you.

	* SF Patch Tracker [ 2836704 ] Patch for Solaris10 compilation and usage.
	Submitted By: zephyrus ( zephyrus00jp )
	Obs by Marcelo: The issue with linking with -lsocket -lnsl -lrt is not
	covered in this changeset beacuse I don't have solaris to test. I will
	need some help from zephyrus in this regard. The issue will be addressed
	in a future changeset.

	Compilation for solaris

	I have used gcc3.x and gcc4.x under solaris 10 for x86 / 64 bits.

	A couple of Source file fixes were necessary for successful compilation
	and runtime behavior.

	threadutil/src/ThreadPool.c

	POSIX
	sched_setschduler() returns non-negative value for success.

	Without the fix, UpnpInit() fails immediately.

	upnpp/src/api/upnpai.c

	There is a typo of a macro name "__sun" in one of the
	CPP conditional.
	Without the fix, the compilation aborts due to unknown constant
	in socket ioctl call.

	A few structs and an array is not properly initialized.
	Well, I think it may be safe as is, but when I checked it
	using purify evaluation version, it was reported that
	uninitizlied iszBuffer may cause read of uninitialized memory.
	So play it safe.

	Configure issue.
	This has to be more of a configure magic.
	To link a program successfully using network, we need
	-lsocket and -lnsl library specifications on the link line.
	We also need -lrt for programs that use thread scheduling features.

	The sample program under upnp/sample requires
	-lsocket -lnsl -lrt
	for successful linking.
	I added -lsocket -lnsl -lrt to Makefile.in.
	configure probably needs to take care of these.

	I don't know much about configure, automake, etc., so
	I am just raising a flag here.

	TIA

	* SF Patch Tracker [ 2836704 ] Search for nested serviceList (not
	stopping at the first lis
	Submitted By: zephyrus ( zephyrus00jp )
	
	Internet Gateway Device description contains nested serviceList (rootdevice
	-> servicelist, subdevice
	and subdevice has the lower-level serviceList, etc..)

	Unfrotunately, the sample code sample_util.c used by tv_device sample,
	etc.
	has a code that looks for only the first top-level serviceList.
	This results in the failure to read all the services of an IGD xml
	description.

	Attached patch modifies this behavior and looks for the service by
	visiting all the serviceList in xml document in turn.

	With the modified patch (ad additional modification), I could
	simulate an IGD device and created a modified control program for that.

	Patch against 1.6.6

	TIA.

	* SF Patch Tracker [ 2857611 ] Declare a few functions to have proper
	(void) argument list.
	Submitted By: zephyrus ( zephyrus00jp )
	
	In a publicly installed headers, a few functions are declared without any
	arguments at all, a la "()".
	When I used gcc's -Wimplict and -Wstrict-prototypes to check for the
	mismatch of
	function prototype declarations and their usage in my own program,
	some headers from libupnp-1.6.6 produced warnings.

	They are not strictly bugs, but pretty much annoying. This is 2009, and
	almost all the important compilers
	understand ISO-C.

	So the offending functions are declared as "(void") to show that they have
	no arguments at all.

2010-03-14 Marcelo Jimenez <mroberto(at)users.sourceforge.net>
	* SF Patch Tracker [ 2546532 ] Missing carriage return between
	SOAPACTION and User-Agent headers.

	There is something going wrong in soap_ctrlpt.c at line 931 (based on
	version 1.6.6 release).
	
	The http_Makemessage call looks as follows:
	
	if (http_MakeMessage(
	&request, 1, 1,
	"Q" "sbc" "N" "s" "s" "Ucc" "sss",
	SOAPMETHOD_POST, path.buf, path.length,
	"HOST: ", host.buf, host.length,
	content_length,
	ContentTypeHeader,
	"SOAPACTION:
	\"urn:schemas-upnp-org:control-1-0#QueryStateVariable\"",
	xml_start, var_name, xml_end ) != 0 ) {
	return UPNP_E_OUTOF_MEMORY;
	}
	
	This will result in the SOAPACTION header to be immediately followed by the
	User-Agent header, while a cr-lf should separate the two. I propose to fix
	this by changing the second "s" to "sc" to force the addition of a cr-lf
	after the SOAPACTION. This looks consistent to the other Makemessage calls.

	* SF Bug Tracker [ 1942285 ]
	UpnpCreatePropertySet can leak memory.
	Submitted By: Bob Ciora - bobciora

	In file upnp/src/api/upnptools.c, function UpnpCreatePropertySet can leak
	memory if no additional arguments are passed. This is because of the
	'return' statement at (or near) line 554.

	The prior call to ixmlParseBufferEx may succeed. This causes a basic ixml
	tree to be created. The return statement at line 554 leaves this tree in
	memory without cleaning it up.

	There are two options: either add code prior to the return at 554 to clean
	up the tree, or simply allow a NumArg parameter of 0 to be passed.

	I prefer the second method -- there doesn't seem to be any need to pass
	*any* arguments to this function.

	In my local copy of upnptools.c, I have simply replaced the "return NULL"
	in line 554 to "return PropSet".

	I've attached the source file.

2008-05-26 Marcelo Jimenez <mroberto(at)users.sourceforge.net>
	* SF Bug Tracker [ 1903069 ]
	Subs (not services) not marked 'active'
	Submitted By: Bob Ciora - bobciora

	If the UpnpAcceptSubscription is not called, the subscription is not marked
	as "active", so no state variables will ever be sent.

	I have a "lazy" architecture where a service may not be ready to publish
	any state data at the time of a subscription. Subscriptions are still
	accepted, there's just nothing to send, so UpnpAcceptSubscription is never
	called. As a result, the subscription is never marked as "active" via the
	genaInitNotify functions.

	A best course of action would be to modify UpnpAcceptSubscription<...>
	functions so that they can accept *no* initial state information, but can
	still result in the subscription being marked as active. Technically,
	then, the "active" flag should be set here, not in the genaInitNotify<...>
	functions.

	But the UpnpAccept functions don't muck with the subscription table, and
	it's more work than it's worth to move that code from the gena fucntions to
	the upnpapi functions.

	So--- what I've done to correct this problem is to modify both
	UpnpAcceptSubscription<...> functions (in upnppapi.c) to accept an empty
	state list and still call the gena layer functions. The gena layer
	genaInitNotify<...> functions (gena_device.c) then mark the subscription as
	"active" *before* checking for an empty state set.

	In genaInitNotify, a check for "var_count <= 0" is added immediately after
	the "subs->active = 1;" line. If this occurs, then all cleanup is
	performed and the function returns GENA_SUCCESS (since now, an empty state
	list is not an error). The same check is made for "PropSet == 0" in
	genaInitNotifyExt (just after the "subs->active = 1;" line).

	I've modifified my proxy layer to call UpnpAcceptSubscriptionExt even when
	there is no state data to send. With the suggested changes to
	gena_device.c, later state changes are sent correctly.

	This has solved my problem.

	defines. These were just aliases, no reason to keep them.

2007-05-25 Marcelo Jimenez <mroberto(at)users.sourceforge.net>
	* Changed the comments of the include files that expose the UPnP API
	to use only C89 comments and no C99 comments.

2007-05-24 Nektarios K. Papadopoulos <npapadop(at)inaccessnetworks.com>
	* Added tvcombo sample that demonstrates coexistence of a device and a

2007-05-24 Nektarios K. Papadopoulos <npapadop(at)inaccessnetworks.com>
	* SF Tracker FR [ 1570020 ].
	* Enable both device and control point in the same application. Resolve

	* Fix Threadpool expansion condition.
	Thanks to Siva Chandran P. for the original patch.

2007-05-24 Nektarios K. Papadopoulos <npapadop(at)inaccessnetworks.com>
	* Modified tvdevice (control and picture) service descriptions to make

	'out' arguments in argument list.
	Thanks to Martin Tremblay for pointing out the solution originally provided
	by MORIOKA Yasuhiro.

2007-05-21 Marcelo Jimenez <mroberto(at)users.sourceforge.net>
	* More MSVC fixes, using XINLINE instead of inline, MSVC has troubles
	with inline. Thanks to David Maass for reporting.
	* Changed XINLINE to UPNP_INLINE.

2007-05-21 Marcelo Jimenez <mroberto(at)users.sourceforge.net>
	* Added the file build/inc/msvc/inttypes.h. This file is for use with
	MSVC only, because it does not provide C99 compatibility.

2007-05-18 Marcelo Jimenez <mroberto(at)users.sourceforge.net>
	* Removed all uses of the DEVICEONLY(x) macro.

2007-05-17 Marcelo Jimenez <mroberto(at)users.sourceforge.net>
	* Removed all uses of the DBGONLY(x) macro. A static inline empty
	function now is used and the compiler takes care of optimizing it out.

2007-05-17 Marcelo Jimenez <mroberto(at)users.sourceforge.net>
	* Fixed a bug in UpnpPrintf, function could call va_start() and return
	befor calling va_end().

2007-05-15 Marcelo Jimenez <mroberto(at)users.sourceforge.net>
	* EXPORT_SPEC missing on some declarations in ixml/inc/ixml.h.
	Thanks to David Maass.

2007-05-15 Marcelo Jimenez <mroberto(at)users.sourceforge.net>
	* sizeof is unsigned, so %zu is more adequate than %zd.

2007-05-15 Marcelo Jimenez <mroberto(at)users.sourceforge.net>
	* Using an invented printf directive PRIzu that on MSVC
	expands to "lu", and on normal C99 compilers expands to "zu".

2007-05-15 Marcelo Jimenez <mroberto(at)users.sourceforge.net>
	* Rewrote raw_find_str. Now it no longer uses strcasestr(), but it
	transforms the first input buffer into lowercase.

2007-05-08 Marcelo Jimenez <mroberto(at)users.sourceforge.net>
	* Fix for debug printf format strings. size_t are not expected
	in a string format like "%.*s".

2007-05-08 Marcelo Jimenez <mroberto(at)users.sourceforge.net>
	* Added inttypes.h as a header requirement in configure.ac.

2007-05-11 Marcelo Jimenez <mroberto(at)users.sourceforge.net>
	* Moved upnp_tv_ctrlpt and upnp_tv_device executables from folder
	upnp to folder upnp/sample. Moved folder upnp/sample/tvdevice/web
	to folder upnp/sample/web. This way, if someone compiles the
	tarball and executes upnp_tv_device from its creation directory,
	there will be no error -108 for not finding directory web.

	Submitted By: Glen Masgai
	after an UpnpSendActionAsync() for example, i get UPNP_E_OUTOF_MEMORY
	in the callback using 1.4.4 on a x86_64 system. This happens in
	http_MakeMessage(), which in some cases get called with wrong types
	(int instead of size_t) in combination with format "b" and "Q".
	The attached patch should fix this.

	* SF Tracker [ 1652827 ] UpnpRegisterRootDevice returned -104
	Submitted By: Michael Andersen - miwer
	
	Issue was found to be related to sizeof (size_t) != sizeof (int)
	on AMD64 systems. Emil Ljungdahl's AMD64 patch has been applied along
	with some other fixes. Original user report follows:

	When I run upnpd I get the above mentioned error (UPNP_E_OUTOF_MEMORY).
	I've tried with 1.4.1 and 1.4.2-RC3, it's the same. I don't understand why,
	because I have plenty of RAM, and I even tried closing some applications,
	but it didn't help.

	$ upnpd eth1 br0

	The following is logged in the /var/log/messages:
	Feb 6 01:33:47 server upnpd[6933]: Error registering the root device with
	descDocUrl: http://192.168.0.1:49152/gatedesc.xml
	Feb 6 01:33:47 server upnpd[6933]: UpnpRegisterRootDevice returned -104


	I tried enabling debugging and it looks like it cannot allocate memory
	through the membuffer_append function. It's wierd because it's only a few
	bytes.

	Please note, that I enabled some extra debugging lines that were commented,
	in order to get more information. See attached files.

Version 1.4.3
*******************************************************************************

2007-03-13 Marcelo Jimenez <mroberto(at)users.sourceforge.net>
	* SF Tracker [ 1663004 ] Compile on Cygwin
	Submitted By: Jon Foster - jongfoster
	This patch gives basic support for building under Cygwin - it compiles,
	links, and a simple UPnP device application can initialise. I'm not sure
	if it actually works yet, but this is definitely a step in the right
	direction.
	
	Patch is against the 1.4.1 release. Changes are:
	
	* threadutil/inc/ithread.h: Fix the ithread mutex support to use
	documented, portable APIs (if present) rather than the Non-Portable (_NP)
	ones it uses now. This is required because Cygwin implements only the
	portable API.
	
	* threadutil/src/ThreadPool.c: Fake SetPolicyType() to do nothing on Cygwin
	because otherwise it fails. Should probably investigate why it fails and
	add a proper implementation later.
	
	* upnp/src/api/upnpapi.c: On Cygwin, zero out the GlobalHndMutex structure
	before initialising it. Without this, the initialisation fails. This
	appears to be a bug in Cygwin.
	
	* upnp/src/genlib/net/uri/uri.c: Use gethostbyname() on Cygwin.
	
2007-03-05 Oxy <oxygenic(at)users.sourceforge.net>
	* Code adapted and typedefs added to compile cleanly under Windows
	with Borland C++ Builder and MS Visual C++

2007-02-02 Marcelo Jimenez <mroberto(at)users.sourceforge.net>

	* Bumped the program version to 1.4.2 in config.ac.

	* Now requires autoconf 2.60.

	* Fixed docdir use.

	* Does not install the documentation by default.

	* Use dist-bzip2 to create a .bz2 distribution file.

	* SF Tracker [ 1634922 ] Support for large files (>= 2 GiB), part 2
	Submitted By: Jonathan Casiot - no_dice
	Summary: This patch hopefully fixes the remaining types and related
	code to enable files >= 2 GiB to be streamed. Jonathan claims to have
	tested this with a patched version of ushare-0.9.8 and a D-Link DSM-520.

2007-01-09 Marcelo Jimenez <mroberto(at)users.sourceforge.net>

	* SF Tracker [ 1628629 ] Multicast interface patch
	Submitted By: Fredrik Svensson - svefredrik
	This patch fixes two problems:
	1) Specify the IP address for the interface when we do
	setsockopt IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP. This makes it possible to run
	when no default router has been configured.
	2) Explicitly set the multicast interface through setsockopt
	IP_MULTICAST_IF. Avoids socket error -207 in some cases.

	the library version excessively, only the necessary numbers
	on the next release.

	Submitted By: Fredrik Svensson - svefredrik
	
	* SF Tracker [ 1628636 ] SSDP packet copy patch
	Submitted By: Fredrik Svensson - svefredrik
