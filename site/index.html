        The portable SDK for UPnP&trade; Devices (libupnp) provides developers
        with an API and open source code for building control points, devices,
        and bridges that are compliant with Version 1.0 of the
        <a href="http://www.upnp.org/resources/upnpresources.zip">
            Universal Plug and Play Device Architecture Specification</a>
        and support several operating systems like Linux, *BSD, Solaris and others.

    <p class="noident"><b><a id="info">General information</a></b></p>

    <p>
        UPnP&trade; is an architecture that enables
        discovery, event notification, and control of devices on a network,
        independent of operating system, programming language, or physical
        network connection.&nbsp; UPnP&trade; is based on common Internet
        standards and specifications such as TCP/IP, HTTP, and XML. For
        detailed information about UPnP&trade;, including the UPnP&trade;
        Device Architecture Specification, please visit the
        <a href="http://www.upnp.org/"> UPnP&trade; Forum web site</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        In 2000, Intel created the first version of the Linux SDK for
        UPnP&trade; Devices and subsequently released it to the open source
        community to foster growth of UPnP&trade;.&nbsp; To learn more
        about&nbsp; Intel's involvement with both UPnP&trade; and the SDK,
        please visit <a href="http://www.intel.com/cd/ids/developer/asmo-na/eng/downloads/upnp/index.htm">
            Intel's Universal Plug and Play web site</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        In 2006 - after some years of stagnation and mismanagement - this 100%
        compatible fork of the original project was created to bring it back to
        life, support further development and to avoid that all the useful and
        important patches and efforts that have been provided by developers get
        lost because none of the original project maintainers/project developers
        were willing or able to integrate them into the source tree. This way,
        the project now continues using the name "Portable UPnP&trade;" and as
        a project that is more open to contributions of the community. The main
        goal is the availability of the project for all important platforms to
        become a standard for UPnP&trade;.

        Documentation is available in PDF format from the
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=166957">
            downloads</a> section.&nbsp; The documentation actually resides inside
        the source code itself and is built into the PDF file by an automated
        process.&nbsp; Documentation for each function resides in a comment
        section immediately preceding the function.
