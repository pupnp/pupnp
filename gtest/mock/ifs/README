This is an example how mocking works. I have used it to learn mocking
free global functions from a C library with C++ Googlemock. With this single
example program it is a good way to get an overview and understand how it works.
To improve and optimize mocking for the pupnp libray I still use it.

To compile it, use ./compile_all.sh. Then you have two executable programs:
./mylib.a        shows your real network interfaces.
./test_mylib.a   runs a test with a mocked interface, independent from the real.
