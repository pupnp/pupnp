 *
 * The {\tt JOBS_PER_THREAD} constant determines when a new thread will be
 * allocated to the thread pool inside the  SDK. The thread pool will
 * try and maintain this jobs/thread ratio. When the jobs/thread ratio
 * becomes greater than this, then a new thread (up to the max) will be
 * allocated to the thread pool.  The default ratio is 10 jobs/thread.

 *
 * The {\tt MIN_THREADS} constant defines the minimum number of threads the

 * always have this number of threads. These threads are used
 * for both callbacks into applications built on top of the SDK and also
 * for making connections to other control points and devices. This number

 * for both callbacks into applications built on top of the library and also
 * for making connections to other control points and devices.  It is not
 * recommended that this value be below 10, since the threads are
 * necessary for correct operation.  This value can be increased for greater

 * applications built on top of the library and also for making connections
 * to other control points and devices.  This value will not be used if it
 * is lower than ITHREAD_STACK_MIN or greater than a system-imposed limit.

 *  event at the head of the queue to be communicated). This parameter will
 *  have no effect in most situations with the default (low) value of
 *  MAX_SUBSCRIPTION_QUEUED_EVENTS. However, if MAX_SUBSCRIPTION_QUEUED_EVENTS
